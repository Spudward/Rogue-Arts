Thank you for purchasing the "Science Lab - Science Bench" pack from KittandaDesign

This is a simple asset pack that contains 4 prefabs from meshes created by me. 

I have set up the prefabs in the Prefab folder for you to drag and drop into your scenes. 

Models
-----
The models are scaled to real world scales according to my online research.

Pivots are baked and UVs are unwrapped

Textures
--------
I have set up the materials for the prefabs using a Standard Specular setup using the maps:
Albedo, AO, Emission, Normal, Specular
There are also the maps for: Basecolor, Metallic, Roughness, if you want to set up differently

Scripts
-------

I wrote a Controller Script for the experience called "ExampleSceneController" and is used to run the example scene. All it does is rotate the center display area if there is a object to display and houses a number of Arrays that you can populate with things you want to display. Feel free to use this code and the objects I have added to the scene for your own work if you choose. 

There is also a properties script for the Cupboard Doors and the Drawers that you will see placed on them in the prefabs. This is so that the opening and closing works in the example scene. Feel free to modify and use that 
script in any way you choose. If you do not want to use it, remember to remove the scripts from those components of the prefabs. They also have tags attached that you might want to remove if not using the script. 

If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me as I am always happy to create more materials for my 
models or work on commissions!

Hope you have a great day further!
